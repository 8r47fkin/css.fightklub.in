which has many meaning keep this for as disclaimer but if you feel your code is misused or never to be looked at and I have used it - Let's talk (i mean, let me review your request and remove your code) , 
(Begineer's Reading and Accessing Technologies!!!!)

according to which, 
if you have openSourced your codes, 
I a trying to lean from interest
Thank you and all credits to you!!!!

Hello World!!!

I am using this repository to learn anything and everything

I have used three.js libraries documentation file as the framework for working on this, as was trying  to learn things and felt, 
this had good fonting style and tweaking that would give a good understanding for me to learn about coding

remember, I am not a self taught programmer, 
rather, I try to learn from anyone and everyone of you!

Most probably, If you had created interesting, 
I mean, which would have got my interest, 

I would have tried to take your codes, 

i currently don't understand, 
licence and money ! 

Currently not using it for earning money,
But with no cash flow for more than a year and half - 
So will learn to build something first to make some real money, 

also,
if you think i have made money from your code, 
let's talk and review your request, 
will pay you the money you are asking for on what i ear(provided, its feasible)

that is if I sell something for $100 and used codes of 9 people, 
I will take 1 persons cost for compiling and distribute the rest to the rest 9 people claiming - does licence works like this????
