		<h1>Mastering Layouts</h1>
        <br>
		<p>	
			CSS provides several tools you can use to control the layout of a web page.
            we’ll look at the most important of these tools, from
			<p>
				<img src="/api/en/css/layouts/ml.jpg" alt="layouts" width="100%">
			</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[link:#api/en/css/layouts/floats/floats Making Sense of floats]
				</li>
                <li>[link:#api/en/css/layouts/flexbox/flexbox Flexbox]
				</li>
                <li>[link:#api/en/css/layouts/grids/grids Grid Layouts]
				</li>
                <li>[link:#api/en/csslayouts/positioning/positioning Positioning]
				</li>
                <li>[link:#api/en/css/layouts/responsive/responsive Responsive design]
				</li>
            </ul>   
			None of these tools is intrinsically better than
			another, but rather they each accomplish something a little different. I’ll show
			you how they each work so you can use this understanding to mix and match
			them on a page to achieve the result you need.
