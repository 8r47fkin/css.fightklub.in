		<h1>Mastering the box model</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            When it comes to laying out elements on the page, you’ll find a lot of things going
            on. On a complex site, you may have floats, absolutely positioned elements, and
            other elements of various sizes. You may also have some layouts using newer CSS
            constructs, such as a flexbox or a grid layout. You have a lot of things to keep track
            of, and learning everything involved with layout can be overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’ll spend several chapters taking a close look at several layout techniques.
            Before we get to those, it’s important to have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of
            how the browser sizes and positions elements. The more advanced topics of layout
            are built atop concepts like document flow and the box model; these are the basic
            rules that determine the position and size of elements on the page.

            In this chapter, you’ll build a two-column page layout. You may be familiar with
            this as a classic beginner exercise for CSS, but I’ll guide you through it in a way that
            highlights several, often-overlooked nuances of layout. We’ll look at some of the edge
            cases of the box model, and I’ll give you practical advice for sizing and aligning 
            elements. We’ll also tackle two of the most notorious problems in CSS: vertical centering
            and equal-height columns.
