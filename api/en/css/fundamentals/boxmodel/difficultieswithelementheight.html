		<h1>Difficulties with element height</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
			Working with element height is different than working with element width. The
			border-box fixes you’ve made thus far still apply and can be helpful; but, typically
			it’s best to avoid setting explicit heights on elements. Normal document flow is
			designed to work with a constrained width and an unlimited height. Contents fill
			the width of the viewport and then line wrap as necessary. Because of this, the
			height of a container is organically determined by its contents, not by the container
			itself.
			<code>
				Normal document flow refers to the default layout behavior of elements on the
				page. Inline elements flow along with the text of the page, from left to right,
				line wrapping when they reach the edge of their container. Block-level elements 
				fall on individual lines, with a line break above and below.
			</code>
			<h3>Controlling overflow behavior</h3>
			<p>
				When you explicitly set an element’s height, you run the risk of its contents overflowing
				the container. This happens when the content doesn’t fit the specified constraint and
				renders outside of the parent element. Figure 3.8 shows this behavior. Document flow
				doesn’t account for overflow, and any content below the container will render over
				the top of the overflowing content.
				<code>
					your code here
				</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				You can control the exact behavior of the overflowing content with the overflow
				property, which supports four values:
				<ul>
					<li>visible (default value)—All content is visible, even when it overflows the container’s edges.</li>
					<li>hidden—Content that overflows the container’s padding edge is clipped and won’t be visible.</li>
					<li>scroll—Scrollbars are added to the container so the user can scroll to see the
						remaining content. On some operating systems, both horizontal and vertical
						scrollbars are added, even if all the content is visible. In this case, the scrollbars
						will be disabled (grayed).</li>
					<li>auto—Scrollbars are added to the container only if the contents overflow.</li>
				</ul>
				Typically, I prefer auto rather than scroll because, in most cases, I don't want the
				scrollbars to appear except when necessary. Figure 3.9 shows four containers with
				these overflow settings.
			</p>
			<code>
				your code here
			</code>
        </p>
		<p>
			Be judicious with the use of scrollbars. Browsers insert a scrollbar for scrolling the
			page, and adding nested scrollable areas inside your page can be frustrating to users.
			If a user is using a mouse scroll wheel to scroll down the page, and their cursor
			reaches a smaller scrollable area, their scroll wheel will stop scrolling the page and will
			scroll the smaller box instead.
		</p>
        <p>

				<h3> Horizontal overflow</h3>
				<p>
					It’s possible for content to overflow horizontally, not just vertically. One typical situation 
					is when a long URL appears in a narrow container. The same rules apply here as
					 with vertical overflow.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can control only horizontal overflow using the overflow-x property, or vertical
					overflow with overflow-y. These properties support the same values as the over
					flow property. Explicitly setting both x and y to different values, however, tends to
					have unpredictable results.
				</p>
			</code>
        </p>
		<h3>Applying alternatives to percentage-based heights</h3>
		<p>
			Specifying height using a percentage is problematic. Percentage refers to the size of
			an element’s containing block; the height of that container, however, is typically determined 
			by the height of its children. This produces a circular definition that the
			browser can’t resolve, so it’ll ignore the declaration. For percentage-based heights to
			work, the parent must have an explicitly defined height.
		</p>
		<p>
			One reason people try to use percentage-based heights is to make a container fill
			the screen. A better approach is to use the viewport-relative vh units, which you
			reviewed in chapter 2. A height of 100 vh is exactly the height of the viewport. The
			most common use, though, is to create columns of equal height. This too can be
			solved without a percentage.
		</p>
		<h3>COLUMNS OF EQUAL HEIGHT</h3>
		<p>
			The columns-of-equal-height problem is one weakness that has plagued CSS from the
			beginning. In the early 2000s, CSS supplanted the use of HTML tables for laying out
			content. At the time, tables were the only way to produce two columns of equal
			height, or, more specifically, columns of the same height without explicitly specifying
			the height. You could easily set all columns to a height of 500 px or some other 
			arbitrary value. But if you allowed the columns to determine their heights naturally, each
			element would evaluate to a different height, based on its content. This became a simple 
			use case fraught with frustration.		   
		</p>
		<p>
			It took some creative hacks to work around the issue. As CSS evolved, solutions
			involving pseudo-elements or negative margins emerged. If you’re still using any of
			these complicated methods, it’s time to fix that. Modern browsers make it much easier 
			they support CSS tables. For example, IE8+ supports display: table, and IE10+
			allows for a flexible box, or flexbox, both of which, by default, produce equal-height
			columns.
		</p>
		<code>
			NOTE When I say modern browsers, I mean recent versions of auto-updating,
			(evergreen) browsers. These include Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and, in
			most cases, Safari. Internet Explorer is the biggest concern; if I say something
			is supported in IE10+, that generally implies the evergreen browsers support
			it as well.
		</code>
		<p>
			A number of common designs call for equal-height columns. Your two-column page is
			a great example. It’d look more polished if you were to align the heights of the main
			column and the sidebar (figure 3.10). As the content in either column grows, each
			column will grow as needed so the bottoms are always flush.
		</p>
		<code>
			insert git here
		</code>
		<p>
			You could accomplish this by setting an arbitrary height on both columns, but what
			value would you choose? Too big, and you’ll have a large empty space at the bottom of
			your containers; too small, and you’ll have overflow to deal with.
		</p>
		<p>
			The best solution is for the columns to size themselves naturally, and then extend
			the shorter column so that its height is equal to the height of the taller one. I’ll show
			you how to do this using both CSS-based table layouts and a flexbox.
		</p>
		<h3>CSS TABLE LAYOUTS</h3>
		<p>
			First, you’ll use a CSS-based table layout. Instead of using floats, you’ll make the con
			tainer a display: table and each column a display: table-cell. Update your styles 
			to match listing 3.9. (You may notice there’s no table-row element. With CSS tables,
			the inclusion of a row element isn’t as strict a requirement as it is with HTML tables.)			
		</p>
		<code>
			insert git here
		</code>
		<p>
			By default, an element with a table display value won’t expand to a 100% width like a
			block element will, so you’ll have to declare the width explicitly b. This code gets you
			close, but now the gutter is missing. That’s because margins c can’t be applied to
			table-cell elements. You’ll have to make more changes to get this exactly how you
			want it.
		</p>
		<p>
			To define space between cells of a table, you can use the border-spacing prop
			erty of the table element. This property accepts two length values: one for horizontal 
			spacing and one for vertical spacing. (You can also specify only one value to apply
			 to both.) You could add border-spacing: 1.5em 0 to your container, but this has a
			 peculiar side effect: that value is also applied to the outside edges of the table. Now
			 your two columns no longer align with the header on the left and right edges (figure 3.11).
		</p>
		<code>
			insert git here
		</code>
		<p>
			You can fix this with the clever use of a negative margin, but that needs to go on a new
			container that wraps around the whole table. Here’s how. Add a <xmp><div class="wrapper"> </xmp> 
			around the container and apply a left and right margin of -1.5 em to counteract
			the 1.5 em of the border spacing on the sidebars. This portion of your stylesheet
			should look like this.
		</p>
		<code>
			insert git here
		</code>
		<p>
			Instead of positive margins pushing in the edges of the container, the negative margin
			pulls the edges out. Combined with border-spacing, the outside column edges now
			align with the edges of the <xmp><body></xmp> (the containing box for the wrapper). You now have
			the layout you want: two columns with equal height, a 1.5 em gutter, and outside
			edges that align with the header (figure 3.12).
		</p>
		<code>
			insert git here
		</code>
		<p>
			Negative margins have some interesting uses that we’ll look at in a bit.

			<h3>Tables for layout?</h3>
				<p>
					If you’ve worked in web development for a while, you’ve likely heard that it’s bad practice 
					to use HTML tables for layouts. Many website designers in the early 2000s laid
					out their sites using <xmp><table></xmp> elements. It was often easier to lay out pages using
					tables instead of fighting with floats (the only viable alternative at the time). 
					Eventually, there was a lot of backlash against the use of tables for layouts because doing
					so meant using non-semantic HTML. Instead of the HTML tags representing content,
					they were doing the work of layout—something CSS should be responsible for.
				</p>
				<p>
					Browsers now support table display for all sorts of elements other than <xmp><table></xmp>, so
					you can enjoy the benefits of table layouts and maintain semantic markup. It’s not a
					"holy grail" solution, however. The HTML table attributes colspan and rowspan have
					no equivalent, and floats, flexboxes, and inline-blocks can layout content in ways that
					tables can’t.
