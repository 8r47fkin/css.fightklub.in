		<h1> Unitless numbers and line-height</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Some properties allow for unitless values (that is, a number with no specified unit).
			Properties that support this include line-height, z-index, and font-weight (700 is
			equivalent to bold; 400 is equivalent to normal, and so on). You can also use the unitless value 
			0 anywhere a length unit (such as px, em, or rem) is required because, in
			these cases, the unit does not matter—0 px equals 0% equals 0 em.
        </p>
		<code>
			WARNING A unitless 0 can only be used for length values and percentages,
			such as in paddings, borders, and widths. It can’t be used for angular values,
			such as degrees or time-based values like seconds.
		</code>
        <p>
            The line-height property is unusual in that it accepts both units and unitless values.
			You should typically use unitless numbers because they’re inherited differently. Let’s
			put text into the page and see how this behaves. Add the code in the following listing
			to your stylesheet.
        </p>
		<code>
			git update - insert here
		</code>
		<p>
			You’ll specify a line height for the body element and allow it to be inherited by the rest
			of the document. This will work as expected, no matter what you do to the font sizes
			in the page (figure 2.11).
		</p>
		<code>
			git update - insert here
		</code>
		<p>
			Add listing 2.21 to your stylesheet for these styles. The paragraph inherits a line height
			of 1.2. Because the font size is 32 px (2 em × 16 px, the browser’s default), the line
			height is calculated locally to 38.4 px (32 px × 1.2). This will leave an appropriate
			amount of space between lines of text.
		</p>
		<code>
			git update - insert here
		</code>
		<p>
			If instead you specify the line height using a unit, you may encounter unexpected
			results, like that shown in figure 2.12. The lines of text overlap one another. Listing 2.22
			shows the CSS that generated the overlap.
		</p>
		<code>
			git update - insert here
		</code>
		<code>
			git update - insert here
		</code>
		<p>
			These results are due to a peculiar quirk of inheritance: when an element has a value
			defined using a length (px, em, rem, and so forth), its computed value is inherited by
			child elements. When units such as ems are specified for a line height, their value is
			calculated, and that calculated value is passed down to any inheriting children. With
			the line-height property, this can cause unexpected results if the child element has a
			different font size, like the overlapping text.
			<code>
				length—The formal name for a CSS value that denotes a distance measurement. 
				It’s a number followed by a unit, such as 5 px. Length comes in two
				 flavors: absolute and relative. Percentages are similar to lengths, but strictly
				 speaking, they’re not considered lengths.
			</code>
			When you use a unitless number, that declared value is inherited, meaning its computed 
			value is recalculated for each inheriting child element. This will almost always 
			be the result you want. Using a unitless number lets you set the line height on the 
			body and then forget about it for the rest of the page, unless there are particular 
			places where you want to make an exception.
