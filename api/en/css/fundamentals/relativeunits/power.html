		<h1>Power of Relative Units</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            CSS brings a late-binding of styles to the web page: The content and its styles aren’t
 pulled together until after the authoring of both is complete. This adds a level of
 complexity to the design process that doesn’t exist in other types of graphic design,
 but it also provides more power—one stylesheet can be applied to hundreds, even
 thousands, of pages. Furthermore, the final rendering of the page can be altered
 directly by the user, who, for example, can change the default font size or resize the
 browser window.
        </p>
        <p>
            In early computer application development (as well as in traditional publishing),
 developers (or publishers) knew the exact constraints of their medium. A particular
 program window might be 400 px wide by 300 px tall, or a page could be 4 in. wide by
 6½ in. tall. Consequently, when developers set about laying out the application’s but
tons and text, they knew exactly how big they could make those elements and exactly
 how much space that would leave them to work with for other items on the screen. On
 the web, this is not the case.
        </p>
        <h3>The struggle for pixel-perfect design</h3>
        <p>
            In the web environment, the user can have their browser window set to any number of
            sizes, and the CSS has to apply to it. Furthermore, users can resize the page after it’s
            opened, and the CSS needs to adjust to new constraints. This means that styles can’t
            be applied when you create your page; the browser must calculate those when the
            page is rendered onscreen.
        </p>
        <p>
            This adds a layer of abstraction to CSS. We can’t style an element according to an
            ideal context; we need to specify rules that’ll work in any context where that element
            could be placed. With today’s web, your page will need to render on a 4-in. phone
            screen as well as on a 30-in. monitor.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a long time, designers mitigated this complexity by focusing on “pixel-perfect”
            designs. They’d create a tightly defined container, often a centered column around
            800 px wide. Then, within these constraints, they’d go about designing more or less
            like their predecessors did with native applications or print publications.
        </p>
        <h3>The end of the pixel-perfect web</h3>
        <p>
            As technology improved and manufacturers introduced higher-resolution monitors,
            the pixel-perfect approach slowly started to break down. In the early 2000s, there was
            a lot of discussion on whether we developers could safely design for displays 1,024 px
            wide instead of 800 px wide. Then, we’d have the same conversation all over again for
            1,280 px. We had to make judgment calls. Was it better to make our site too wide
            for older computers or too narrow for new ones?
        </p>
        <p>
            When smartphones emerged, developers were forced to stop pretending everyone
            could have the same experience on their sites. Whether we loved it or hated it, we had
            to abandon columns of some known number of pixels, and begin thinking about
            responsive design. We could no longer hide from the abstraction that comes with CSS.
            We had to embrace it.
        </p>

            responsive—In CSS, this refers to styles that “respond” differently, based on
            the size of the browser window. This entails intentional consideration for
            mobile, tablet, or desktop screens of any size. We’ll take a good look at
            responsive design in chapter 8, but in this chapter, I’ll lay some important
            groundwork before we get there.

        <p>
            Added abstraction means additional complexity. If I give an element a width of 800
            px, how will that look in a smaller window? How will a horizontal menu look if it
            doesn’t all fit on one line? As you write your CSS, you need to be able to think simulta
           neously in specifics, as well as in generalities. When you’ve multiple ways to solve a
            particular problem, you’ll need to favor the solution that works more generally under
            multiple and different circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Relative units are one of the tools CSS provides to work at this level of abstraction.
            Instead of setting a font size at 14 px, you can set it to scale proportionally to the size
            of the window. Or, you can set the size of everything on the page relative to the base
            font size, and then resize the entire page with a single line of code. Let’s take a look at
            what CSS provides to make this sort of approach possible.
        </p>

        <code>
            Pixels, points and picas
            CSS supports several absolute length units, the most common of which, and the
            most basic, is the pixel (px). Less common absolute units are mm (millimeter), cm
            (centimeter), in. (inch), pt (point—typographic term for 1/72nd of an inch), and pc
            (pica—typographic term for 12 points). Any of these units can be translated directly
            to another if you want to work out the math: 1 in. = 25.4 mm = 2.54 cm = 6 pc = 72
            pt = 96 px. Therefore, 16 px is the same as 12 pt (16 / 96 × 72). Designers are often
            more familiar with the use of points, where developers are more accustomed to pixels, 
            so you may have to do some translation between the two when communicating
            with a designer.

            Pixel is a slightly misleading name—a CSS pixel does not strictly equate to a monitor’s 
            pixel. This is notably the case on high-resolution (“retina”) displays. Although
            the CSS measurements can be scaled a bit, depending on the browser, the operating
            system, and the hardware, 96 px is usually in the ballpark of 1 physical inch
            onscreen, though this can vary on certain devices or with a user’s resolution settings.
