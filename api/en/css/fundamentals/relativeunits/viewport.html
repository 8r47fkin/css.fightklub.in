		<h1>Viewport-relative units</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            You’ve learned that ems and rems are defined relative to font-size, but these aren’t
			the only type of relative units. There are also viewport-relative units for defining lengths
			relative to the browser’s viewport.
        </p>
		<code>
			viewport—The framed area in the browser window where the web page is visible. 
			This excludes the browser’s address bar, toolbars, and status bar, if present.
		</code>
        <p>
			If you’re not familiar with viewport-relative units, here is a brief explanation.
			<ul>
				<li> vh—1/100th of the viewport height </li>
				<li> vw—1/100th of the viewport width</li>
				<li> vmin—1/100th of the smaller dimension, height or width (IE9 supports vm instead of vmin)</li>
				<li> vmax—1/100th of the larger dimension, height or width (not supported in IE or, at the time of writing, Edge)</li>
			</ul>
			For example, 50 vw is equal to half the width of the viewport, and 25 vh equals 25% of
			the viewport’s height. vmin is based on which of the two (height or width) is smaller.
			This is helpful for ensuring that an element will fit on the screen regardless of its orientation: 
			If the screen is landscape, it’ll be based on the height; if portrait, it’s based
			on the width.
        </p>
		<p>
			Figure 2.10 shows a square element as it appears in several viewports with different
			screen sizes. It’s defined with both a height and a width of 90 vmin, which equals 90%
			of the smaller of the two dimensions—90% of the height on landscape screens, or
			90% of the width on portrait.
		</p>
		<p>
			Listing 2.18 shows the styles for this element. It produces a large square that always
			fits in the viewport no matter how the browser is sized. You can add a <xmp<div class=
			"square">></xmp> to your page to see this.

			The viewport-relative lengths are great for things like making a large hero image fill
			the screen. Your image can be inside a long container, but setting the image height to
			100 vh, makes it exactly the height of the viewport.

			NOTE Viewport-relative units are a newer feature for most browsers, so there
			are a few odd bugs when you use them in more exotic combinations with
			other styles. See “Known Issues” at http://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units
			for a list.

			<h3>CSS3</h3>
			<p>
				Several of the unit types in this chapter weren’t in earlier versions of CSS (rems and
				viewport-relative units, in particular). They were added amid a series of changes to
				the language, which is often called CSS3.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the late 1990s and early 2000s, after initial work on the CSS specification, little
				changed for a long time. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) published the CSS
				2 specification in May 1998. Shortly thereafter, work began on version 2.1 to correct
				issues and bugs in version 2. Work on CSS 2.1 continued for many years, with few
				significant additions to the language. It was not finalized as a Proposed 
				Recommendation until April 2011. By this point, browsers had already implemented most of the
				CSS 2.1 changes, and were well on their way to adding newer features under the
				moniker CSS3.			   
			</p>
			<p>
				The “3” is an informal version number; there’s no CSS3 specification. Instead, the
				specification was broken up into individual modules, each independently versioned.
				The specification for backgrounds and borders is now separate from the one for box
				models, and from the one for cascading and inheritance. This allows the W3C to
				make new revisions to one area of CSS without unnecessarily updating areas that
				are not changing. Many of these specifications remain at version 3 (now called level
				3), but some, such as the selectors specification, are at level 4 and others, such as
				a flexbox, are at level 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				As these changes were introduced, we saw an explosion of new features rolling out
				in browsers from 2009 through 2013. Notable additions at this time included rems
				and viewport-relative units, as well as new selectors, media queries, web fonts,
				rounded borders, animations, transitions, transformations, and different ways to
				specify colors. And, new features are steadily emerging each year.
			</p>
			<p>
				This means we’re no longer working with one particular version of CSS. It’s a living
				standard. Each browser is continually adding support for new features. Developers
				work with those changes and adapt to them. There won’t be a CSS4, except perhaps
				as a more generic marketing term. Although this book covers CSS3 features, I don’t
				necessarily call them out at as such because, as far as the web is concerned, it’s
				all CSS.
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>Using vw for font size</h3>
		<p>
			One application for viewport-relative units that may not be immediately obvious is
			font size. In fact, I find this use more practical than applying vh and vw to element
			heights or widths.
		</p>
		<p>
			Consider what would happen if you applied font-size: 2vw to an element. On a
			desktop monitor at 1,200 px, this evaluates to 24 px (2% of 1,200). On a tablet with a
			screen width of 768 px, it evaluates to about 15 px (2% of 768). And, the nice thing is,
			the element scales smoothly between the two sizes. This means there’re no sudden
			breakpoint changes; it transitions incrementally as the viewport size changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, 24 px is a bit too large on a big screen. And worse, it scales all the
			way down to 7.5 px on an iPhone 6. What would be nice is this scaling effect, but with
			the extremes a little less severe. You can achieve this with CSS’s calc() function.
		</p>
		<h3>Using calc() for font size</h3>
		<p>
			The calc() function lets you do basic arithmetic with two or more values. This is 
			particularly useful for combining values that are measured in different units. This 
			function supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/). 
			The addition and subtraction operators must be surrounded by whitespace, so I suggest
			getting in the habit of always adding a space before and after each operator; 
			for example, calc(1em + 10px).
		</p>
		<p>
			You’ll use calc() in the next listing to combine ems with vw units. Remove the
			previous base font size (and the related media queries) from your stylesheet. Add this
			in its place.
		</p>
		<code>
			git update here
		</code>
		<p>
			Now, open the page and slowly resize your browser. You’ll see the font scale smoothly
			as you do. The 0.5 em here operates as a sort of minimum font size, and the 1 vw adds
			a responsive scalar. This’ll give you a base font size that scales from 11.75 px on an
			iPhone 6 up to 20 px in a 1,200 px browser window. You can adjust these values to
			your liking. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You’ve now accomplished a large piece of your responsive strategy without a single
			media query. Instead of three or four hard-coded breakpoints, everything on your
			page will scale fluidly according to the viewport.
