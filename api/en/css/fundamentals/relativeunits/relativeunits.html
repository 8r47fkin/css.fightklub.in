		<h1>Working with Relative Units</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            When it comes to specifying values, CSS provides a wide array of options to choose
 from. One of the most familiar, and probably easiest to work with, is pixels. These
 are known as absolute units; that is, 5 px always means the same thing. Other units,
 such as em and rem, are not absolute, but relative. The value of relative units
 changes, based on external factors; for example, the meaning of 2 em changes
 depending on which element (and sometimes even which property) you’re using it
 on. Naturally, this makes relative units more difficult to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Developers, even experienced CSS developers, often dislike working with relative 
            units, the notorious em included. The way the value of an em can change
 makes it seem unpredictable and less clear-cut than the pixel. In this chapter, I’ll
 remove the mystery surrounding relative units. First, I’ll explain the unique value
 they bring to CSS, then I’ll help you make sense of them. I’ll explain how they 
 work, and I’ll show you how to tame their seemingly unpredictable nature. You can
 make relative values work for you, and wielded correctly, they’ll make your code simpler, 
 more versatile, and easier to work with.
