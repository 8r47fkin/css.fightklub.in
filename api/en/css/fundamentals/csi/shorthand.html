		<h1>Shorthand Properties</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Shorthand properties are properties that let you set the values of several other properties
            at one time. For example, font is a shorthand property that lets you set several font
            properties. This declaration specifies font-style, font-weight, font-size, line
           height, and font-family:
        </p>
        <xmp>font: italic bold 18px/1.2 "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif;</xmp>
        <p>
            Similarly, 
            <ul>
                <li> background is a shorthand property for multiple background properties:
                    background-color, background-image, background-size, background-repeat,
                    background-position, background-origin, background-chip, and background
                   attachment.</li>
                <li> border is a shorthand for border-width, border-style, and border-color, which
                    are each in turn shorthand properties as well.</li>
                <li> border-width is shorthand for the top, right, bottom, and left border widths. </li>
            </ul>
            Shorthand properties are useful for keeping your code succinct and clear, but a few
 quirks about them aren’t readily apparent.
            <h3><b>Beware shorthands silently overriding other styles </b></h3>
            <p>
                Most shorthand properties let you omit certain values and only specify the bits you’re
 concerned with. It’s important to know, however, that doing this still sets the omitted
 values; they’ll be set implicitly to their initial value. This can silently override styles you
 specify elsewhere. If, for example, you were to use the shorthand font property for
 the page title without specifying a font-weight, a font weight of normal would still be
 set (figure 1.12).
            </p>
            <code>
            <img src="" alt="">
                git fetch git merge or git pull then git add . git commit -m "message"
             </code>
            <p>
                Add the code from this listing to your stylesheet for an example of how this works.
            </p>
            <code>
                <img src="" alt="">
                    git fetch git merge or git pull then git add . git commit -m "message"
            </code>
            <p>
                At first glance, it may seem that <xmp><h1 class="title"></xmp> would result in a bold heading,
                    but it doesn’t. These styles are equivalent to this code.
            </p>
            <code>
                <img src="" alt="">
                    git fetch git merge or git pull then git add . git commit -m "message"
            </code>
            <p>
                This means that applying these styles to <xmp><h1></xmp> results in a normal font weight, not bold.
                    It can also override other font styles that would otherwise be inherited from an ances
                   tor element. Of all the shorthand properties, font is the most egregious for causing
                    problems, because it sets such a wide array of properties. For this reason, I avoid using
                    it except to set general styles on the <xmp><body></xmp> element. You can still encounter this prob
                   lem with other shorthand properties, so be aware of this possibility.
            </p>
            <h3><p>Understanding the order of shorthand values</p></h3>
            <p>
                Shorthand properties try to be lenient when it comes to the order of the values you
                specify. You can set border: 1px solid black or border: black 1px solid and either
                will work. That’s because it’s clear to the browser which value specifies the width,
                which specifies the color, and which specifies the border style.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there are many properties where the values can be more ambiguous. In these
                cases, the order of the values is significant. It’s important to understand this order for
                the shorthand properties you use.
                <h3>TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT</h3>

                    Shorthand property order particularly trips up developers when it comes to properties
                like margin and padding, or some of the border properties that specify values for each
                of the four sides of an element. For these properties, the values are in clockwise order,
                beginning at the top. 
            </p>
                <p>
                    Remembering this order can keep you out of trouble. In fact, the word TRouBLe is
                an mnemonic you can use to remember the order: top, right, bottom, left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use this mnemonic to set padding on the four sides of an element. The links
                    shown in figure 1.13 have a top padding of 10 px, right padding of 15 px, bottom pad
                   ding of 0, and left padding of 5 px. This looks uneven, but it illustrates the principle.
                
                <code>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                        git fetch git merge or git pull then git add . git commit -m "message"
                </code>
                Properties whose values follow this pattern also support truncated notations. If the
                declaration ends before one of the four sides is given a value, that side takes its value
                from the opposite side. Specify three values, and the left and right side will both use
                the second one. Specify two values, and the top and bottom will use the first one. If
                you specify only one value, it will apply to all four sides. Thus, the following declara
                tions are all equivalent:
                <code>
                    padding: 1em 2em;
                    padding: 1em 2em 1em;
                    padding: 1em 2em 1em 2em;
                </code>
                These are equivalent to one another as well:
                <code>
                    padding: 1em;
                    padding: 1em 1em;
                    padding: 1em 1em 1em;
                    padding: 1em 1em 1em 1em;
                </code>
                For many developers, the most problematic of these is when three values are given.
                Remember, this specifies the top, right, and bottom. Because no left value is given, it
                will take the same value as the right; the second value will be applied to both the left
                and right sides. Thus, padding: 10px 15px 0 applies 15 px padding to both the left
                and right sides, whereas the top padding is 10 px and the bottom padding is 0.               
            </p>
            Most often, however, you’ll need two values. On smaller elements in particular, it’s
            often better to have more padding on the sides than on the top and bottom. This
            approach looks good on buttons or, in your page, navigational links (figure 1.14).
            <code>
                <img src="" alt="">
                    git fetch git merge or git pull then git add . git commit -m "message"
            </code>
            Update your stylesheet to match this listing. It uses the property shorthand to apply
            the vertical padding first, then the horizontal.
            <code>
                <img src="" alt="">
                    git fetch git merge or git pull then git add . git commit -m "message"
            </code>
            Because so many common properties follow this pattern, it’s worth committing this
            order to memory.
            <h3><b>HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL</b></h3>
            The TRouBLe mnemonic only applies to properties that apply individually to all four
            sides of the box. Other properties only support up to two values. These include 
            properties like background-position, box-shadow, and text-shadow (although these aren’t
            shorthand properties, strictly speaking). Compared to the four-value properties like
            padding, the order of these values is reversed. Whereas padding: 1em 2em specifies
            the vertical top/bottom values first, followed by the horizontal right/left values,
            background-position: 25% 75% specifies the horizontal right/left values first, 
            followed by the vertical top/bottom values.
            <p>
                Although it seems counter-intuitive that these are opposite, the reason for this is
     straightforward: the two values represent a Cartesian grid. Cartesian grid measurements are 
     typically given in the order x, y (horizontal and then vertical). If, for example, 
     you wanted to apply a shadow like the one shown in figure 1.15, you’d specify the
     x (horizontal) value first.
            </p>
            <code>
                <img src="" alt="">
                  cascade from left ((git fetch && git merge) : (git pull)) && (git add .) + (git commit -m "message")
            </code>
            The first (larger) value applies to the horizontal offset, whereas the second (smaller)
 value applies to the vertical.
            <p>
                If you’re working with a property that specifies two measurements from a corner,
                think “Cartesian grid.” If you’re working with one that specifies measurements for
                each side all the way around an element, think “clock.”
            </p>
            <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Keep selector specificity under control.</li>
                <li>Don’t confuse cascade with inheritance.</li>
                <li> Certain properties are inherited, including those for text, lists, and table borders.</li>
                <li>Don’t confuse initial and auto values.</li>
                <li>Stay out of TRouBLe with shorthand properties.</li>
            </ul>
