		<h1>Special Values</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are two special values that you can apply to any property to help manipulate the
 cascade: inherit and initial. Let’s take a look at these.
            <h3><b>Using the inherit keyword</b></h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes, you’ll want inheritance to take place when a cascaded value is preventing
            it. To do this, you can use the keyword inherit. You can override another value with
            this, and it will cause the element to inherit that value from its parent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose you add a light gray footer to your page. In the footer, there may be some
 links, but you don’t want them to stand out too much because the footer’s isn’t an
 important part of the page. So you’ll make the links in the footer dark gray (figure 1.10).
            </p>
            <code>
                goes here - git update
            </code>
            <p>
            Add this markup to the end of your page. A normal page would have more content
 between this and the header, but this will serve the purpose.
            </p>
            <code>
                goes here - git update
            </code>
            <p>
                Typically, you’ll have a font color set for all links on the page (and if you don’t, the
 user agent styles sets one), and that color is applied to the Terms of Use link as well.
 To make the link in the footer gray, you’ll need to override it. Add this code to your
 stylesheet to do that.
            </p>
            <code>
                update here - git pull
            </code>
            <p>
                The third ruleset here overrides the blue link color, giving the link in the footer a cas
caded value of inherit. Thus, it inherits the color from its parent, <xmp><footer>.</xmp>
            </p>
            <p>
                The benefit here is that the footer link will change along with the rest of the footer
 should anything alter it. (Editing the second ruleset can do this, or another style else
where could override it.) If, for example, the footer text on certain pages is a darker
 gray, then the link will change to match.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use the inherit keyword to force inheritance of a property not nor
                mally inherited, such as border or padding. There are few practical uses for this, but
                 you’ll see one useful case in chapter 3 when we look at box sizing.
            </p>
            <h3><b>Using the initial keyword</b></h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes you’ll find you have styles applied to an element that you want to undo.
                You can do this by specifying the keyword initial. Every CSS property has an initial,
                or default, value. If you assign the value initial to that property, then it effectively
                resets to its default value. It’s like a hard-reset of that value. Figure 1.11 shows how
                your footer renders if you give it a value of initial rather than inherit.
            </p>
            <code>
                update here - git pull
            </code>
            <p>
                The CSS in figure 1.11 is shown in the following listing. Because black is the initial
 value for the color property in most browsers, color: initial is equivalent to color:
 black.
            </p>
            <code>
                update here - git pull
            </code>
            <p>
                The benefit of this is you don’t have to think about it as much. If you want to remove a
 border from an element, set border: initial. If you want to restore an element to its
 default width, set width: initial.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may be in the habit of using the value auto to do this sort of reset. In fact, you
                can use width: auto to achieve the same result. This is because the default value of
                width is auto.               
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s important to note, however, that auto isn’t the default value for all properties.
                It’s not even valid for many properties; for example, border-width: auto and pad
               ding: auto are invalid and therefore have no effect. You could take the time to dig up
                the initial value for these, but it’s often easier to use initial.
            </p>
            <code>
                NOTE Declaring display: initial is equivalent to display: inline. It won’t
                evaluate to display: block regardless of what type of element you apply it to.
                That’s because initial resets to the initial value for the property, not the ele
                ment; inline is the default value for the display property.
            </code>
        </p>
