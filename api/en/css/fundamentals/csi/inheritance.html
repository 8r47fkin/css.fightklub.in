		<h1>Inheritance</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            There’s one last way that an element can receive styles—inheritance. The cascade is frequently conflated with the concept of inheritance. Although the two topics are
             related, you should understand each individually.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an element has no cascaded value for a given property, it may inherit one from
            an ancestor element. It’s common to apply a font-family to the <xmp><body></xmp> element. All
            the ancestor elements within will then inherit this font; you don’t have to apply it
            explicitly to each element on the page. Figure 1.8 shows how inheritance flows down
            the DOM tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all properties are inherited, however. By default, only certain ones are. In general, these are the properties you’ll want to be inherited. They are primarily properties
             pertaining to text: color, font, font-family, font-size, font-weight, font-variant,
             font-style, line-height, letter-spacing, text-align, text-indent, text-transform,
             white-space, and word-spacing.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few others inherit as well, such as the list properties: list-style, list-style-type, 
            list-style-position, and list-style-image. The table border properties,
            border-collapse and border-spacing, are also inherited; note that these control
            border behavior of tables, not the more commonly used properties for specifying
            borders for non-table elements. (We wouldn’t want a <XMP><div></XMP> passing its border down to
            every descendant element.) This is not quite a comprehensive list, but very nearly.
           </p>

           <p>
            You can use inheritance in your favor on your page by applying a font to the body
            element, allowing its descendant elements to inherit that value (figure 1.9).
           </p>
           <img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/ex1.png" alt="header fightklub.in" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
           <p>
            Add this code to the top of your stylesheet to apply this principle to your page.
           </p>
           <code>
            body {
                font-family: sans-serif;
               }
           </code>
           <p>
            This is applied to the entire page by adding it to the body. But you can also target a
            specific element on the page, and it will only inherit to its descendant elements.
            The inheritance will pass from element to element until it’s overridden by a cas
           caded value.           
           </p>
           <h3><b> Use your DevTools!</b></h3>
           <p>
            A complicated nest of values inheriting and overriding one another can quickly
 become difficult to keep track of. If you’re not already familiar with your browser’s
 developer tools, get in the habit of using them.
           </p>
           <p>
            DevTools provide visibility into exactly which rules are applying to which elements
 and why. The cascade and inheritance are abstract concepts; DevTools are the
 best way I know to get my bearings. Open them by right-clicking an element and
 choosing Inspect or Inspect Element from the context menu. Here’s an example of
 what you’ll see.
           </p>
           <img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/ex5.png" alt="inheritance" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
           <p>
            The style inspector shows every selector targeting the inspected element, ordered by
            specificity. Below that are all inherited properties. This shows all of the cascade and
            inheritance for the element at a glance.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are lots of subtle features to help you make sense of what's happening with
            an element's styles. Styles closer to the top override those below. Overridden styles
            are crossed out. The stylesheet and line number for each ruleset are shown on the
            right, so you can find them in your source code. This tells you exactly which element
            inherited which styles and where they originated. You can also type in the Filter box
            at the top to hide all but a certain set of declarations.
