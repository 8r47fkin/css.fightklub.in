		<h1>Cascade</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Fundamentally, CSS is about declaring rules: Under various conditions, we want certain things to happen. 
            If this class is added to that element, apply these styles. If element X is a child of element Y, 
            apply those styles. The browser then takes these rules,
        figures out which ones apply where, and uses them to render the page.
        </p>

<p>
    When you look at small examples, this process is usually straightforward. But as
your stylesheet grows, or the number of pages you apply it to increases, your code can
become complex surprisingly quickly. There are often several ways to accomplish the
same thing in CSS. Depending on which solution you use, you may get wildly different
results when the structure of the HTML changes, or when the styles are applied to 
different pages. A key part of CSS development comes down to writing rules in such a
way that they’re predictable.
</p>
<img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/2.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<p>
    The first step toward this is understanding how exactly the browser makes sense of
    your rules. Each rule may be straightforward on its own, but what happens when two
    rules provide conflicting information about how to style an element? You may find
    one of your rules doesn’t do what you expect because another rule conflicts with it.
    Predicting how rules behave requires an understanding of the cascade.

<p>
    To illustrate, you’ll build a basic page header like one you might see at the top of a
web page (figure 1.1). It has the website title atop a series of teal navigational links.
The last link is colored orange to make it stand out as a sort of featured link.

<img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/ex1.png" alt="header fightklub.in" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    As you build this page header, you’ll probably be familiar with most of the CSS
involved. This will allow us to focus on aspects of CSS you might take for granted or
only partially understand.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/4.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
    To begin, create an HTML document and a stylesheet named styles.css. Add the code
 in the HTML.
</p>

<p>
        <code>
        <xmp>
            
        <!doctype html>
        <head>
            <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
        </head>
        <body>
            <header class="page-header">
                <h1 id="page-title" class="title">Welcome to Fightklub.in</h1>
                <nav>
                <ul id="main-nav" class="nav">
                    <li><a href="">Learn</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">Play</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">Shop</a></li>
                    <li><a href="" class="featured">Klub</a></li>
                </ul>
                </nav>
            </header>
        </boody>
        </xmp>
    </code>
</p>

<p>
    When two or more rules target the same element on your page, the rules may provide
 conflicting declarations. The next listing shows how this is possible. It shows three
 rulesets, each specifying a different font style for the page title. The title can’t have
 three different fonts at one time. Which one will it be? Add this to your CSS file to see.

    <xmp>
        h1 {                                -- tag(or type) selector
            font-family: serif;
           }


           #page-title {                    -- ID selector
            font-family: sans-serif;
           }


           .title {                         -- class selector
            font-family: monospace;
           }
    </xmp>
</p>

<img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/fk2.gif" alt="" width="100%">


<p>
    Rulesets with conflicting declarations can appear one after the other, or they can be
    scattered throughout your stylesheet. Either way, given your HTML, they all target the
    same element.
</p>

<p>
    All three rulesets attempt to set a different font family to this heading. Which one
    will win? To determine the answer, the browser follows a set of rules, so the result is
    predictable. In this case, the rules dictate that the second declaration, which has an ID
    selector, wins; the title will have a sans-serif font.
</p>

<img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/5.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<p>
    The cascade is the name for this set of rules. It determines how conflicts are
 resolved, and it’s a fundamental part of how the language works. Although most experienced 
 developers have a general sense of the cascade, parts of it are sometimes
 misunderstood.
</p>
<img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/6.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

<p>
    Let’s unpack the cascade. When declarations conflict, the cascade considers three
    things to resolve the difference:
    <ol>
        <li> Stylesheet origin — Where the styles come from. Your styles are applied in conjunction with the browser’s default styles.</li>
        <li> Selector specificity — Which selectors take precedence over which.</li>
        <li> Source order — Order in which styles are declared in the stylesheet.
        </li>
    </ol>
    The rules of the cascade are considered in this order. Figure 1.3 shows how they’re
    applied at a higher level.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/7.jpg" alt="orgin tracing" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>
<p>
    These rules allow browsers to behave predictably when resolving any ambiguity in the
    CSS. Let’s step through them one at a time.
</p>

<h3> Understanding stylesheet origin</h3>

<p>
    The stylesheets you add to your web page aren’t the only ones the browser applies.
    There are different types, or origins, of stylesheets. Yours are called author styles; there
    are also user agent styles, which are the browser’s default styles. User agent styles have
    lower priority, so your styles override them.
</p>
<code>
    NOTE Some browsers let users define a user stylesheet. This is considered a
    third origin, with a priority between user agent and author styles. User styles
    are rarely used and beyond your control, so I’ve left them out for simplicity.
</code>

<p>
    User agent styles vary slightly from browser to browser, but generally they do the same
    things: headings <xmp>(<h1> through <h6>)</xmp> and paragraphs <xmp>(<p>)</xmp> are given a top and bottom margin, 
         <xmp>(<ol> and <ul>)</xmp> lists are given a left padding, and link colors and default
    font sizes are set.
</p>
<h3> <b>USER AGENT STYLES</b></h3>

<p>
    Let’s look again at the example page we are working on. The title is sans-serif because of the
    styles you added. A number of other things are determined by the user agent styles:
    the list has a left padding and a list-style-type of disc to produce the bullets. Links
    are blue and underlined. The heading and the list have top and bottom margins.
</p>
<img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/ex3.png" alt="orgin tracing" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

<p>
    After user agent styles are considered, the browser applies your styles—the author
 styles. This allows declarations you specify to override those set by the user agent
 stylesheet. If you link to several stylesheets in your HTML, they all have the same origin: the author.
</p>

<p>
    The user agent styles set things you typically want, so they don’t do anything
 entirely unexpected. When you don’t like what they do to a certain property, set your
 own value in your stylesheet. Let’s do that now. You can override some of the user
 agent styles that aren’t what you want so your page will look like figure 1.5.
</p>

<p>
    In the following listing, I’ve removed the conflicting font-family declarations from the
 earlier example and added new ones to set colors and override the user agent margins
 and the list padding and bullets. Edit your stylesheet to match these changes.
 <img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/fk3.gif" alt="orgin tracing" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
 <code>
    h1 {
        color: #2f4f4f;
        margin-bottom: 10px;
    }
    
    #main-nav {
        margin-top: 10px;
        list-style: none;
        padding-left: 0;
    }
    
    #main-nav li {
        display: inline-block;
    }
    
    #main-nav a {
        color: white;
        background-color: #13a4a4;
        padding: 5px;
        border-radius: 2px;
        text-decoration: none;
    }
 </code>
 <img src="/api/en/css/fundamentals/csi/ex2.png" alt="orgin tracing" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

</p>


<p>
    If you’ve worked with CSS for long, you’re probably used to overriding user agent
 styles. When you do, you’re using the origin part of the cascade. Your styles will always
 override the user agent styles because the origins are different.
</p>
<code>
    NOTE You may notice I used ID selectors in this code. There are reasons to
    avoid doing this, which I’ll cover in a bit.
</code>

<h3><b> IMPORTANT DECLARATIONS</b></h3>
<p>
    There’s an exception to the style origin rules: declarations that are marked as important. 
    A declaration can be marked important by adding !important to the end of the
     declaration, before the semicolon:
     <xmp>color: red !important;</xmp>
     Declarations marked !important are treated as a higher-priority origin, so the overall
     order of preference, in decreasing order, is this:
     <ol>
        <li>Author important</li>
        <li>Author</li>
        <li>User agent</li>
     </ol>
     The cascade independently resolves conflicts for every property of every element on
     the page. For instance, if you set a bold font on a paragraph, the top and bottom margin 
     from the user agent stylesheet still applies (unless you explicitly override them).
     The concept of style origin will come into play when we get to transitions and animations 
     because they introduce more origins to this list. The !important annotation is
     an interesting quirk of CSS, which we’ll come back to again shortly.
