		<h1>Cascade, specificity, and inheritance</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            CSS is unlike a lot of things in the world of software development. It’s not a programming language, strictly speaking, but it does require abstract thought. It’s not
 purely a design tool, but it does require some creativity. It provides a deceptively
 simple declarative syntax, but if you’ve worked with it on any large projects, you
 know it can grow into unwieldy complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you need to learn to do something in conventional programming, you
            can usually figure out what to search for (for example, “How do I find items of type
            x in an array?”). With CSS, it’s not always easy to distill the problem down to a single
            question. Even when you can, the answer is often “it depends.” The best way to
            accomplish something is often contingent on your particular constraints and how precisely you’ll want to handle various edge cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            While it’s helpful to know some “tricks” or useful recipes you can follow, mastering
 CSS requires an understanding of the principles that make those practices possible.
 This book is full of examples, but it is primarily a book of principles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Part 1 begins with the most fundamental principles of the language: the cascade,
 the box model, and the wide array of unit types available. Most web developers know
 about the cascade and the box model. They know about pixel units and may have
 heard that they “should use ems instead.” The truth is, there’s a lot to these topics,
 and a cursory understanding of them gets you only so far. If you’re ever to master CSS,
 you must first know the fundamentals, and know them deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know you’re excited to start learning the latest and greatest CSS has to offer. That
            is the exciting stuff. But first, we’ll go back to the fundamentals. I’ll quickly review the
            basics, which you’re likely already familiar with, and then dive deep into each topic.
            My aim is to strengthen the foundation on which the rest of your CSS is built.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this chapter, we begin with the C in CSS—the cascade. I’ll articulate how it
 works, then show you how to work with it practically. We then look at a related topic,
 inheritance. I’ll follow that with a look at shorthand properties and some common
 misunderstandings surrounding them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, these topics are all about applying the styles you want to the elements
            you want. There’s a lot of “gotchas” here that often trip up developers. A good
            understanding of these topics will give you better control over making your CSS do
            what you want it to do. With any luck, you’ll also better appreciate and even enjoy
            working with CSS.
        </p>
		
        <h2>The cascade</h2>
        <p>
            Fundamentally, CSS is about declaring rules: Under various conditions, we want certain things to happen. 
            If this class is added to that element, apply these styles. If element X is a child of element Y, 
            apply those styles. The browser then takes these rules,
 figures out which ones apply where, and uses them to render the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you look at small examples, this process is usually straightforward. But as
 your stylesheet grows, or the number of pages you apply it to increases, your code can
 become complex surprisingly quickly. There are often several ways to accomplish the
 same thing in CSS. Depending on which solution you use, you may get wildly different
 results when the structure of the HTML changes, or when the styles are applied to dif
ferent pages. A key part of CSS development comes down to writing rules in such a
 way that they’re predictable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step toward this is understanding how exactly the browser makes sense of
            your rules. Each rule may be straightforward on its own, but what happens when two
            rules provide conflicting information about how to style an element? You may find
            one of your rules doesn’t do what you expect because another rule conflicts with it.
            Predicting how rules behave requires an understanding of the cascade.           
        </p>
        <p>
            To illustrate, you’ll build a basic page header like one you might see at the top of a
 web page (figure 1.1). It has the website title atop a series of teal navigational links.
 The last link is colored orange to make it stand out as a sort of featured link.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you build this page header, you’ll probably be familiar with most of the CSS
 involved. This will allow us to focus on aspects of CSS you might take for granted or
 only partially understand.
