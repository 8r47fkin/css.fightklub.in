            Part 1 begins with the most fundamental principles of the language: the cascade,
 the box model, and the wide array of unit types available. Most web developers know
 about the cascade and the box model. They know about pixel units and may have
 heard that they “should use ems instead.” The truth is, there’s a lot to these topics,
 and a cursory understanding of them gets you only so far. If you’re ever to master CSS,
 you must first know the fundamentals, and know them deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know you’re excited to start learning the latest and greatest CSS has to offer. That
            is the exciting stuff. But first, we’ll go back to the fundamentals. I’ll quickly review the
            basics, which you’re likely already familiar with, and then dive deep into each topic.
            My aim is to strengthen the foundation on which the rest of your CSS is built.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this chapter, we begin with the C in CSS—the cascade. I’ll articulate how it
 works, then show you how to work with it practically. We then look at a related topic,
 inheritance. I’ll follow that with a look at shorthand properties and some common
 misunderstandings surrounding them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, these topics are all about applying the styles you want to the elements
            you want. There’s a lot of “gotchas” here that often trip up developers. A good
            understanding of these topics will give you better control over making your CSS do
            what you want it to do. With any luck, you’ll also better appreciate and even enjoy
            working with CSS.
