            CSS is unlike a lot of things in the world of software development. It’s not a programming language, strictly speaking, but it does require abstract thought. It’s not
 purely a design tool, but it does require some creativity. It provides a deceptively
 simple declarative syntax, but if you’ve worked with it on any large projects, you
 know it can grow into unwieldy complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you need to learn to do something in conventional programming, you
            can usually figure out what to search for (for example, “How do I find items of type
            x in an array?”). With CSS, it’s not always easy to distill the problem down to a single
            question. Even when you can, the answer is often “it depends.” The best way to
            accomplish something is often contingent on your particular constraints and how precisely you’ll want to handle various edge cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            While it’s helpful to know some “tricks” or useful recipes you can follow, mastering
 CSS requires an understanding of the principles that make those practices possible.
 This doc is full of examples, but it is primarily a doc of principles.
